# HeapSort


In this chapter, we introduce another sorting algorithm: HeapSort. Like merge sort, but unlike insertion sort, heapsort's running time
is O (n log n). Like insertion sort, but unlike merge sort heapsort sorts in place: only a constant number of array elements are stored
outside the input array at any time.
